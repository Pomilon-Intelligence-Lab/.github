# 🔬 Pomilon Intelligence Lab

**A fancy name for my personal AI experiments.**

Welcome to the **Pomilon Intelligence Lab**. Despite the official-sounding name, this isn't a company or a research team. It's just me (**Pomilon**) organizing my chaotic "learning-by-doing" projects so they don't clutter up my personal profile.

### 👤 About
I'm a university student and hobbyist exploring how LLMs work under the hood. I run most of my code on my Laptop or local Linux servers, trying to squeeze performance out of consumer hardware.

I use this "Lab" to host:
* Experimental architectures I'm testing.
* Model checkpoints that are too big for GitHub.
* Weird proofs-of-concept that might break at any moment.
