# 🔬 Pomilon Intelligence Lab

**A fancy name for my personal AI experiments.**

> **IMPORTANT**: Treat repositories you find here as artifacts/experiments, not finished products or frameworks. Things may not work as intended or as claimed because they might still be in development/active research.

Welcome to the **Pomilon Intelligence Lab**. Despite the official-sounding name, this isn't a company or a research team. It's just me (**[@pomilon](https://github.com/pomilon)**) organizing my chaotic "learning-by-doing" projects so they don't clutter up my personal profile.

### 👤 About

I'm a university student and hobbyist exploring how LLMs work under the hood. I run most of my code on my laptop or local Linux servers, trying to squeeze performance out of consumer hardware.

I use this organization to host:
* **Source code** for experimental architectures I'm testing.
* Training pipelines and inference scripts.
* Weird proofs-of-concept that might break at any moment.

> **Note:** The heavy model weights for these projects are hosted over at my [Hugging Face Profile](https://huggingface.co/pomilon).
